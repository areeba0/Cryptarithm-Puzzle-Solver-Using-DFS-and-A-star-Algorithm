# Cryptarithm-Puzzle-Solver-Using-DFS-and-A-star-Algorithm
## Overview
This jupyter notebook provides a solution for cryptarithmetic puzzles using two different approaches: Depth-First Search (DFS) and A* Search Algorithm. Cryptarithm puzzles are mathematical puzzles where the digits are replaced by letters of the alphabet, and each letter represents a unique digit. The objective is to find the digit corresponding to each letter to satisfy the given arithmetic equation.

## Features
### Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solver using DFS Algorithm: 
Provides a method to solve puzzles by exploring all possible mappings of letters to digits in a depth-first manner.
### Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solver using A Algorithm*: 
Utilizes a heuristic-driven approach to efficiently explore possible mappings and find a solution.
### Evaluation and Printing: 
Includes functionality to evaluate and print the solution in a human-readable format.

## Dependencies
- Python
- jupyter notebook
- heapq
- itertools
